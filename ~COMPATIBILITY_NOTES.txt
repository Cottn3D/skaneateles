Several pages feature code that requires connection to a database. Currently all related code is commented out to prevent errors. To function correctly again it will require a setup including:

- working php install (and mysql maybe?)
- updated dbconf file (in inc folder)
- recreated data tables with correct formatting (comments, shopping_list, food_list) - in inc folder
- uncomment all sql references
